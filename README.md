# Netick2-Facepunch-Transport
 A Transport class for Netick that uses SteamNetworkingSockets with Facepunch.Steamworks
 
 Credits: 
  - Adevian: Showed me how to write the Netick 1 transport
  - Me: Updated netick 1 transport to netick 2, wrote the SteamNetworkingSockets code
  - Karrar: Created Netick
  - Maclay: Helped cleanup the project files & code

 Features:
 - Steam Lobbies and matchmaking example
   - Create public, private, and friends only lobbies
   - Public lobby search with distance queries
   - Steam command line to auto-join lobbies on startup, when the game is started by clicking "join friend" on steam
 - Free Peer-to-peer with no port forwarding and no IP leaking, thanks to SteamNetworkingSockets and the steam relay
 - Easy to quickly integrate into your Netick project
 
 TODO:
  - voice chat (will add when karrar updates netick to support sending data on the transport level)
